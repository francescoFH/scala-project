Scala Project
-------------

A Scala worksheet is a file that contains Scala definitions and expressions that are evaluated from top to bottom.\
You can think of it as a persistent REPL session that you can edit and run again.

_In Metals, the worksheet is automatically evaluated every time you save it._
